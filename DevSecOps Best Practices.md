1. Maintain cordial relationships with Developers/QA and Operation teams.
2. Do not fail builds unless you are at maturity level 3 or 4.
3. Do not run any tool which takes more than 10 minutes in CI/CD pipelines.
4. Create separate jobs for each tool/scan.
5. Roll out tools/scans in phases (iteratively) even when critical/high severity issues are found.
6. Do not buy tools that does not provide APIs or CLIs.
7. Love the vendor who does per-use licensing model with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.
8. Verify if the tool vendors support incremental/baseline scans
9. Create SAST/DAST custom rule sets. Tools are of no use without creating custom rules/tweaks down the line
10. Do Everything as Code (EaC) to provide the audit-ability, measurability, and security.
11. Do False Positives as Code to control scope of the scans.
12. Link tool wiki in the pipeline as a comment for sharing your teamâ€™s expertise with others.
